# Andy’s RoboFont Hacks, RoboFont Extension

by Andy Clymer, [www.andyclymer.com](http://www.andyclymer.com)

Some small add-ons for the RoboFont editor — extra preferences, tweaks, adjustments, and slightly modified app behavior. A selection of extras to make RoboFont work the way I like it.


### Component Switcher

Quickly jump to a component’s base glyph (and back).

In a glyph window, double-click a component to jump to its base glyph. While you’re editing the component you’ll see a preview of the composed glyph you just came from off to the right. Double-click this preview to jump back to the composed glyph.

### Hotkey – Jump to Foreground

Assigns the “f” key to jump back to the “foreground” layer.

### Hotkey – Nudge Align

Hold the “Command” key while nudging with the arrow keys to align the selected points with other points or glyph metrics.

### Hotkey – Show/Hide Layers

Assigns the “h” key to show/hide layer outlines.

### Maintain Glyph Zoom

RoboFont usually adjusts the glyph view to fit when you switch between glyphs or layers, this option will maintain the same zoom settings as you switch to a different drawing in the same window.

### Snap Closed Only While Dragging

Only “snap to close” open contours while the mouse clicked down and dragging. This prevents open ended contours from joining together when moving a point with the arrow keys.
